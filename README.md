## Project Contents‚§µÔ∏è
<ol>
  <li>index.html:The main file containing the HTML structure for the login and signup pages.</li>
  <li>styles.css: CSS file for styling the pages and making the interface user-friendly.</li>
  <li>script.js: JavaScript file containing client-side logic to simulate the login and signup process.</li>
</ol>

## Usage Instructions‚§µÔ∏è
<ol>
  <li>Download or clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
  <li>Open the index.html file in a web browser.</li>
  <li>Interact with the login and signup screen.</li>
  <li>xperience the functionality of switching between login and signup screens.</li>
</ol>

## Authentication Logic‚§µÔ∏è
<ul>
  <li>Login: The login is simulated by comparing the username and password. If the credentials are correct, a success message is displayed; otherwise, a failure message is shown.</li>
  <li>Sign up: The signup is simulated by checking if both the username and password fields are filled. If they are, a success message is displayed; otherwise, a failure message is shown.</li>
</ul>

## Disclaimer‚ÄºÔ∏è
The authentication logic is performed on the client side only to illustrate basic concepts. In a production environment, secure authentication should be implemented on the server side.
